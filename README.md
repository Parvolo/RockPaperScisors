# RockPaperScisors
Ever wanted to play a game on a mainframe? Especially "Rock paper scisors?"  Well now you can. Just because you can.

If you don't have a mainframe but still want to run the script, then you need a REXX interpretor. 
"What is REXX"  REXX is some cool oldschool scripting languate which runs natively on IBM z/OS mainframes.
"The code looks incredably simple...."  Yes because I am not a good programmer. Also I made this more than 5 years ago....
"Then why did you make this?" Because why not. There aren't that many games that run natively on mainframes... Now you at least have something to play...
"Some language in the game is vulgar...." Yes. Otherwise it would be even more boring...

Enjoy :')
